# Zit
Compiled Language. Easy af. Yet particularly particular. Let's give it a go.

## Hello World.

Open your favourite terminal and execute the following:

```
	zit templates helloworld
```

This will create a new project from a Zit template as such:

```
	helloworld/
		src/
			helloworld.zit
		bin/
			helloworld
```
